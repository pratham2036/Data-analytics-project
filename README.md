# Digit Classification with scikit-learn
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a basic digit classification model using scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten digit images and tested to evaluate its accuracy. The project uses the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning for digit recognition.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains raw image data of handwritten digits.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for training the model and evaluating performance.
results/: Output files including model performance metrics and accuracy results.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the necessary packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image representing a digit from 0 to 9.

### How to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-classification.git
cd digit-classification
Prepare the Environment:

Make sure you have all the required libraries installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies as follows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Analysis:

You can start by running the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for an interactive exploration of the data, or execute the Python scripts in the scripts/ directory.

To train and evaluate the model, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_and_evaluate.py
Review Results:

After running the analysis, you can find the results in the results/ directory. This includes accuracy metrics and visualizations of the model performance.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the digit classification model is evaluated using accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified digits. The results of the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test dataset are saved in the results/ directory.

### Example Output
The output of the model training and evaluation will include:

Accuracy Score: The overall accuracy of the model on the test dataset.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the number of correct and incorrect classifications for each digit.
Classification Report: Detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each digit class.
